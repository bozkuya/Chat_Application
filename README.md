# Chat_Application
 Chat Application Developed with PHP
Users are able to create chat groups, join these groups, and send messages within them. For simplicity, the groups are public: any user can join any group. Users should be able to list all the messages within a group.
The data is stored in a simple SQLite database. All communication between the client and server happens over a simple RESTful JSON API over HTTP(s).
Slim framework is used for routing.
